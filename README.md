# This repo is actually my second repo, the first is Caltech-owned and operated, thus not visible publicly. 
# I might port over that repository at some point, but I'm too lazy right now.

# Hello! I'm Ethan Alderete, currently attending Caltech and majoring in Astrophysics.

# My Frosh summer, I was unable to find an internship (thank the ghostst) and worked at a coffee shop.

# This summer, I am working with Gregg Hallinan and the Caltech Radio Astronomy group to set up
# the LWA's data processing pipeline. Once it's set up, I will hopefully use it to observe
# VT 1137-0337, the first observed extragalactic Pulsar Winde Nebulae. Our hope is that we will see
# emit at least one FRB, thus cementing another confirmed source of the so-far elusive transient bursts.
# It is too early to tell if our venture will be successful.
